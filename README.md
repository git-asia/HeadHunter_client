## Business Objective of the application

The primary objective of this application is to facilitate seamless connections between HR professionals, particularly headhunters, and aspiring IT professionals seeking job opportunities.

Key Features:
1. Empowering Mega K Trainees: The application will provide a unified platform for Mega K trainees to effectively showcase their skills and abilities.

2. Streamlined Candidate Selection: HR professionals will benefit from the application's intuitive interface, enabling them to effortlessly identify and evaluate suitable candidates, conduct interviews, and extend collaboration offers.

3. Efficient Database Management: The application will offer an administrator the necessary tools to efficiently manage access and permissions for the trainee database.

4. Complementary Market Presence: Rather than directly competing with existing job portals, our product aims to augment the job market by offering unique value propositions, with a particular focus on serving the needs of Mega K trainees.

By harmonizing the HR and IT job-seeking landscape, our application strives to bridge the gap between talent and opportunities, fostering meaningful collaborations and driving mutual success.
